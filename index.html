    <h1>Cats</h1>
    <br/>
    <body>Cats are fun creatures.
         Cats can be big and small. 
         Cats are known for their many features.
          I'll tell you why you should love them all!
          <h2>Cats have Claws</h2>
          <p>Cats have a total of 18 claws that can retract. 
            There are five in the front and four in the back.
            Just like humans, cats claws are made from keratin.
